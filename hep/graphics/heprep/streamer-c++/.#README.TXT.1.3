**********************************************************************
 XML Streamer implementation of the HepRep (version 2) driver in c++.

 Author: Mark Donszelmann
**********************************************************************

This implementation allows a C++ program to write HepRep XML files.

For documentation on HepRep (version 1 and 2) see:
http://heprep.freehep.org/

The implementation implements the HepRep (version 2) standard
in write only mode. Although it appears that you are creating a full
HepRep tree, you are only allowed to add children to the current node
or any node above. One is not allowed to keep ptr's to nodes of any leaves.

The Streamer does NOT keep the tree in memory, but streams it directly
to XML.

An example is available under the name: HepRepStreamerExample.cc

The distribution is available for: Linux, Windows and MacOS X.

You need the HEPREP library as well.

There exists also a pure-java version.
