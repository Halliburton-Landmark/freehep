      <h1>Release Notes</h1>

      <p>These release notes are in reverse chronological order.</p>
      <h2>Latest Version</h2>
      <p>Head of CVS</p>
      <h3>Libraries</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed xercesSamples.jar, xerces.jar and their tool file to check xml.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Swing Extensions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added a TableLayout class which uses the standard GridBagLayout but allows
            easier setup and use.
      </ul>
      <h3>Utility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed classes: XercesDOMParser, StreamingCharFactory, DOMParser and DocumentFinishedException,
            and updated all XML related classes to be dependent on JAXP for their parser.
        <li>Added a UserProperties class which allows for storage of non string types,
            and cascaded lookups.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Infrastructure and Tools</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Removed jar.inf from build.xml. You can now set jar.metainfdir and jar.metainf
            to include for instance a service directory</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-1: upgraded to Ant version 1.5.3.</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-1: build file now uses -source 1.4 for compilation.</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-206: upgraded JavaCC to version 3.0, and AID to version 0.9</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-176: a flag to control generation of exceptions in C++ code
            was added. In aid.cpp.properties you may set useExceptions to true/false.
            The default is set to true. AIDA and HEPREP have their flags set to false.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>FreeHEP IO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>IndentPrintWriter now properly overloads all print() and println() methods.</li>
        <li>Added NoCloseOutputStream which only flushes the output.</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-190: Added Base64 Input and Output Streams.</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-191: Added ReaderInputStream and WriterOutputStream.</li>
        <li>FREEHEP-210: Added DecompressableInputStream and CompressableOutputStream,
            which can start (de)compressing midstream. BitInputStream and BitOutputStream
            inherit from these respective classes now.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>ROOTIO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added latest version of ROOTIO.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>VectorGraphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-49: Tests for Font Embedding added.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-217: ExportDialog replaces by SimpleExportDialog</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-217: Base classes for Exporting moved to package org.freehep.util.export.
                VectorGraphics and ImageIO Plugin classes stay in packages
                org.freehep.graphics2d and org.freehep.graphicsio and its subpackages.
                This allows you to add new ExportFileTypes and have a Dialog that uses
                them, by adding new plugin jar files to the classpath.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-39, FREEHEP-57, FREEHEP-58: Redid all the option panels for all drivers</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-199: AbstractPathConstructor calls quad method rather than making cubics.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-196: SymbolShape now has proper bounding box.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-185 and FREEHEP-187: Added transparency for normal (non-image) drawing to the PDF and SVG formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-202: Fixed PrintColor class to rely on JDK 1.4 Color constants.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-204: Added WebColor class to create Colors following the 216-web color
                scheme.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-207: endExport() now calls dispose() on top-level graphics context, which may call
                writeGraphicsSave().</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PixelGraphics2D</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-205: The drawSymbol and fillSymbol methods in PixelGraphics2D will use
                image blitting of cached symbol images of max size 32x32, in the case
                the display is local (Windows32, MacOSX and X11local). In the X11 Remote
                case normal drawing procedures are used. The colors are converted to
                WebColors. For VectorGraphics export everything stays as normal.</li>
          </ul>
      <h4>EMF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-193: Header properly padded.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>GIF, JPG, PNG, PPM</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-243: Antialias and AntialiasText are now options for ImageGraphics2D,
                so can be used on any of the image formats. Defaults are on for both,
                except for the GIF format, which defaults both to off since it would
                result in too many colors. The tests use AntialiasText off since
                it seems to generate time-dependent information in the image formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-19: JPEG Driver was fixed, uses non-transparent RGB BufferedImage.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-212: GIF and PPM are now ImageIO plugins, separately packaged as jar files.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-212: PNG and JPG are now relying on Sun's implementation. Encoder for PNG is
                still available but may be removed in the future.</li>
            <li>GIF Driver separately packaged so that one can remove it for distribution.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>JAVA</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-214: Added JAVA Driver which saves aa Java source file of what has been
                drawn to the screen. This is to enable users to easily generate test files.
                Limitations are currently:
                <ul>
                    <li>no images can be written (FREEHEP-236),</li>
                    <li>generated class may get too large (FREEHEP-237),</li>
                    <li>transforms are wrong (FREEHEP-238)</li>
                    <li>displayed component will not resize (FREEHEP-239)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PDF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed Encoding for FontEmbedderType1</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-203: Cleaned up the PDF output regarding empty objects.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-235: Changed encoding of PS from ISOLatin to STDLatin. The hyphen
                now encodes properly.</li>
            <li>Removed EPSIExportFileType since it was not used.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>SVG</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-189: PNG Images now embedded into SVG format.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>SWF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-223: DefineJPEG2 and DefineJPEG3 implemented correctly. DefineBits and JPEGTables can only be read
                and written, but cannot be created.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-59: upgraded to version 6.0</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-197: swf file can now be partially compressed for version 6.0</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-195: proper bounding boxes written.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-75: glyphed text added to output.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-74: Fixed a problem with curved shapes.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-24, FREEHEP-119 and FREEHEP-171: Added imaging (including transparency) to the SWF format.
                It also handles setPaint(TexturePaint) now.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-22: clip now properly written.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>HepRep</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-9: HepRep output from C++ and Java now writes scientific format
                for doubles and floats with a precision of 6.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Version 1.1 (March 20, 2003)</h2>
