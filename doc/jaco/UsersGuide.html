<p>This release of Jaco is very preliminary, as is this documentation. Items in
the documentation in <font color="#FF0000">red</font> are planned but not yet
implemented.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of Jaco is to make it easy to access C++ objects from Java. All Java
virtual machines include a mechanism for calling routines written in other
languages, called the Java Native Interface (JNI). The JNI is fine for calling
routines written in C (or event Fortran) from Java, but it does not by itself
provide a convenient mechanism for making C++ objects accessible to the Java
programmer as Java objects. Accessing a C++ object from Java using JNI typically
involves hand coding a combination of C and Java code for each method in the C++
object, a tedious and error-prone task.</p>
<p>Jaco addresses this problem by automating the generation of this glue code,
and in addition provides some extra functionality to aid in managing objects in
a cross-language environment. The basic OO functionality of Java and C++ is very
similar, so there is a fairly natural mapping between C++ objects and Java
objects. C++ does support a number of features which are not supported by Java
and currently these features are not supported by Jaco. Limitations currently
imposed by Jaco include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No support for templates</li>
  <li>No support for operator overloading</li>
  <li>Only C++ methods that accept primitives, or simple object references
    supported</li>
  <li>Only methods that return void, primitives or simple object references
    supported</li>
  <li>No access to C++ member variables from Java (they should be private
    anyway)</li>
  <li>It is not possible to subclass a C++ class from Java.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jaco does support</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple inheritance of C++ objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Jaco maps each C++ object to a Java object, called a proxy. Each Java proxy
will implement an interface of the same name as the C++ class, and with the same
public methods as the corresponding C++ class. Jaco supports multiple
inheritance, so for each superclass of the C++ class the Java object will
implement a super-interface of the C++ class. Each Java proxy object will also
implement a CPPProxy interface, which has a few utility methods in it applicable
to all proxy classes. This is illustrated below.</p>
<p>Jaco maintains a table which maps C++ classes to their Java Proxy (and
vice-versa). This enables Jaco to guarantee that if two references to the same
C++ object exist in the Java program, they will both refer to the same Java
proxy object. Java proxy objects will be automatically garbage when they are no
longer in use, and the entry in the Jaco map will be automatically cleaned up
too. Various objection exist for handling the C++ objects when their Java proxy
is garbage collected.</p>
<p>Jaco is designed to be used in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Where the main routine of the program is written in Java, and C++ code is
    called from Java.</li>
  <li>Where the main routine is written in C++ (or some other native language),
    and Java code is invoked from C++.</li>
</ol>
<p>The details of how Jaco is used is slightly different in these two cases, and
is described separately below.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous Topics</h2>
<h3>Using the Jaco Command Line Tool</h3>
<p>To be written.</p>
<h3>Creating C++ objects from Java</h3>
<p>C++ objects can be created from a Java program, but the mechanism is not as
simple as using the normal Java new operator. Since each C++ class is
represented in the Java program by a Java interface, a compile time error will
occur if an attempt is made to use the new operator. (Java interfaces can not be
created with the new operator).</p>
<p>Instead the create method in the corresponding Proxy class must be called
(the proxy class has the same name as the C++ class, but with the postfix
Proxy). One create method will exist for each (overloaded) public constructor in
the C++ class.</p>
<pre>Track t = TrackProxy.create();</pre>
<h3>Deleting C++ objects from Java</h3>
<p>C++ objects can be deleted from Java by calling the delete method in the
CPPProxy interface which all Java proxy objects implement. <font color="#FF0000">Once
a C++ object has been explicitly deleted any attempt to call a method of the
proxy object will result in a NoSuchObject exception.</font></p>
<pre>Track t = TrackProxy.create();
t.delete();</pre>
<h3>Calling static methods of C++ classes from Java</h3>
<p>Static methods in C++ classes can be called by invoking the static method
with the same name on the Java proxy class, e.g.:</p>
<pre>TrackProxy.setPrimaryVertex(v);</pre>
<h3>Lifetime of C++ objects</h3>
<p>C++ objects allocated on the heap, must be explicitly deleted by the user
when they are no longer needed. Java objects on the other hand are automatically
deleted by the system when they are no longer in use (a process called garbage
collection). Jaco allows C++ objects to be explicitly created and deleted using
the mechanisms discussed above. <font color="#FF0000">In addition a Java proxy
can be set to automatically delete its corresponding C++ object when the Java
object is no longer in use, using the setDeleteCPPObjectWhenProxyFinalized()
method in the CPPProxy interface which all Java proxy objects implement. This
must be used with care since there is no check whether other C++ objects have
references to the C++ object being deleted.</font></p>
<pre><font color="#FF0000">Track t = TrackProxy.create();
t.setDeleteCPPObjectWhenProxyFinalized();</font></pre>
<h3>Java Access to C++ Objects Which No Longer Exist</h3>
<p><font color="#FF0000">In the case where a C++ object is deleted explicitly <i>from
Java,</i> any further attempt to invoke methods of its Java proxy class will
result in a NoSuchObject exception being throw.</font> Unfortunately if the C++
object is deleted from C++ code, the Jaco interface has no way to know that the
object has been deleted, and most likely the entire program will core dump.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">To avoid this possibility it is possible to modify the
C++ classes which will have Java proxies to extend JacoProxy. In this case when
the C++ object is deleted, the Jaco manager will be informed, and the entry in
the C++&lt;--&gt;Java map modified so that any future attempt to access the C++
object from Java will result in a NoSuchObject exception.</font></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Using C++ classes from a program with a Java main routine.</h3>
<p>When used in this way all of the C++ (and any other native) code must be
compiled and linked into one or more dynamic load libraries (typically .so file
on Unix, and .dll files under Windows). These libraries are then loaded from
Java using the System.loadLibrary() method. Once the native code is loaded new
C++ objects can be created as described above.</p>
<p>The steps involved are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the Jaco command line tool on the .h file for each C++ object which
    will be accessed from java.</li>
  <li>Compile all of the C++ code, plus the C++ code generated by Jaco in step
    1.</li>
  <li>Link all of the C++ code into one of more dynamic load libraries. You will
    need to include a reference to the jaco library in your link.</li>
  <li>Compile all of your Java code.</li>
  <li>Make sure that all required libraries are located in your PATH, or
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH</li>
  <li>Run the Java program.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using Java classes from a program with a C++ main routine.</h3>
<p>Before invoking any Java code you must create an instance of JacoManager.
When used in this way your C++ program will dynamically start the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) when JacoManager is created. You can specify the path to the JVM
to be started, and the CLASSPATH to use, as arguments to JacoManager, otherwise
default will be used.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Not yet supported. </font></p>
<h3>Documentation ToDo</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Should we have a different naming convention for the xxxProxy classes. It
    is confusing since we refer to the objects as proxies even when we refer to
    them by their interfaces. </li>
</ol>
