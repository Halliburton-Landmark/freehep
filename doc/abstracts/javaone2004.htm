<h1>JavaOne 2004, Session 2858</h1>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>The FreeHEP Open Source Vector Graphics Package and Lightweight Application 
Framework</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Java has been used extensively as a tool for scientific visualization and 
data mining in High-Energy Physics. A number of components have emerged from 
this work which are useful in a much wider context. These have been packaged and 
made available as part of an open-source Java library, called the FreeHEP Java 
Library. </p>
<p>In this presentation we will discuss two components of the FreeHEP Java 
library:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The FreeHEP Vector Graphics package, which allows any Java2D based application to 
  write high quality output using vector rather than bitmap graphics formats, 
  such as CGM, EMF, EPS/PS, SVG and SWF. The Vector Graphics package is 
  sandwiched between the standard Graphics2D class and Java's IO system. A set 
  of base and utility classes are provided to allow current and new formats to 
  reuse existing functionality. Classes for a particular format are packaged in 
  self-registering jar files, which allows easy addition and removal of any 
  driver.</li>
  <li>The FreeHEP Lightweight Application Framework - a toolkit which allows 
  rapid development of desktop Java applications. Key features include the 
  ability to define menus and toolbars using simple XML files, a simple &quot;command 
  dispatch&quot; mechanism for coupling menu items to code, and a &quot;plug-in&quot; mechanism 
  which enables applications to be assembled from independent modules.</li></li>
</ol>
<p>We will describe how to use these components in your own applications, and 
cover some of the design issues and problems involved in implementing them. We 
will also demonstrate several applications built using these components: 
 
Icon Browser, a simple demonstration application, JAS, a general purpose data 
analysis tool, and WIRED, a reusable physics visualization tool.</p>

<h2>Biography Mark Dönszelmann</h2>
<p>Mark is a Computer Scientist and leads the WIRED Event Display visualization project in High Energy Physics. Formerly working at the European 
Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) near Geneva, he recently moved to&nbsp; the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) 
near Palo Alto. He 
is one of the main contributors of FreeHEP project, working on subjects such as 
Vector Graphics and Abstract Interfaces for Data Analysis (AIDA). Though he 
prefers using Java, his surroundings compel him to interface to C++ using the 
Java Native Interface (JNI). </p>
<p>Being at CERN at the time of the birth of the World-Wide Web, he worked with 
Tim Berners-Lee on the VMS port of the CERN web server. He gave many 
talks at conferences about the Web and its application in High Energy Physics. As a lecturer  of the CERN School of 
Computing he has given lectures and tutorials in Java and Java-related subjects, 
such as Information Systems and Mobile Agents. </p>
<h2>Biography Tony S. Johnson</h2>
<p>Tony is a physicist working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center near 
Palo Alto where he has developed software for scientific analysis and 
visualization for over 20 years. He was an early contributor to the World-Wide 
Web, developing the Midas web browser, a precursor to the Mosaic browser. Tony 
is the project lead for the JAS data mining application.</p>
<p>He has made many presentations at international conferences and schools on 
data analysis and visualization, software architecture and novel web 
applications.</p>
