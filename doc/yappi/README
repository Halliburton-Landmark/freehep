The web of YaPPI is created and maintained
using DreameWeaver 3. It uses a template
in the Templates directory.
=============================================
The delivery of the web is now simply the
building of the war file. Thus, when making
the war file, include whatever you included 
to make it, plus the doc/yappi dir which
contains all the html stuff plus word, frame
and so on. You can if you like exlude the 
following files when making the war:

.doc
.fm
.vsd
.clp
.wmk
.emf
.ppt
