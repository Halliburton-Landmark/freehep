        <li>FREEHEP-258: XMLWriter now properly encodes in unicode for characters between 0x80 and 0xFF</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Infrastructure and Tools</h3>

            AID version 0.9.1</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>FreeHEP IO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added LineNumberWriter to keep track of number of lines written. Allows a Listener.</li>
        <li>ByteOrderOutputStream and FlateOutputStream can now write images. An ImageOutput

        <li>FREEHEP-210: Added DecompressableInputStream and CompressableOutputStream,
            which can start (de)compressing midstream. BitInputStream and BitOutputStream
            inherit from these respective classes now.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>ROOTIO</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added latest version of ROOTIO.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>VectorGraphics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-264: ExportDialog will properly append extension when browsing for a file name.
                It will also ignore the default name if a user preference was saved.</li>
            <li>VectorGraphicsTransferable was moved from org.freehep.graphicsio.exportchooser to
                org.freehep.util.export.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-266: Added invert() method to PrintColor with guaranteed contrast. Used
                it in BackgroundPanel for selection of color and text.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-230: Creator properly set for all output formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-260: Background color can be set from options and Transperency can
                also be toggled. Applies to all formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-254: The background is correctly set from the component (if available)
                and the formats now correctly write out the background if they do not support
                transparency (CGM, EMF, JPG, PS and PPM).</li>
            <li>Images handling redone, to handle images of different types and to avoid the PixelGrabber class.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-249: Curly artifacts fonts of Type 1 (PDF/PS) inclusion are fixed.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-247: Warnings and errors can be printed by setting AbstractVectorGraphicsIO.EMIT_WARNINGS,
                or EMIT_ERRORS property to true.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-248: Tests were added for Preview and Thumbnails (PS and PDF).</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-49: Tests for Font Embedding added.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-217: ExportDialog replaces SimpleExportDialog</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-217: Base classes for Exporting moved to package org.freehep.util.export.
                VectorGraphics and ImageIO Plugin classes stay in packages
                org.freehep.graphics2d and org.freehep.graphicsio and its subpackages.
                This allows you to add new ExportFileTypes and have a Dialog that uses
                them, by adding new plugin jar files to the classpath.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-39, FREEHEP-57, FREEHEP-58: Redid all the option panels for all drivers</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-199: AbstractPathConstructor calls quad method rather than making cubics.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-196: SymbolShape now has proper bounding box.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-185 and FREEHEP-187: Added transparency for normal (non-image) drawing to the PDF and SVG formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-202: Fixed PrintColor class to rely on JDK 1.4 Color constants.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-204: Added WebColor class to create Colors following the 216-web color
                scheme.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-207: endExport() now calls dispose() on top-level graphics context, which may call
                writeGraphicsSave().</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PixelGraphics2D</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-218: Blitting of symbols made into renderinghint, which defaults to ON,
                except for JPG which uses non-transparent image to draw in, which would result
                in blitting of images with a black background. PPM does not suffer from this
                since it uses transparent images to write to a file, even if the format itself
                does not allow for transparency. JPEG images have to be written on TYPE_INT_RGB
                or they end up as blank pages, see SUN bug 4775930</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-256: Setting the font to Symbol or ZapfDingbats maps the ascii range
                into the corresponding unicode ranges.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-205: The drawSymbol and fillSymbol methods in PixelGraphics2D will use
                image blitting of cached symbol images of max size 32x32, in the case
                the display is local (Windows32, MacOSX and X11local). In the X11 Remote
                case normal drawing procedures are used. The colors are converted to
                WebColors. For VectorGraphics export everything stays as normal.</li>
          </ul>
      <h4>EMF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-91, FREEHEP-179: Used AlphaBlend tag to implement Transparent Images.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-63, FREEHEP-90: Logical fonts are now properly translated to Windows fonts.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-88, FREEHEP-89: Symbol and ZapfDingbats are now mapped to "Arial Unicode MS",
                since there is no standard Unicode Serif font on Windows with all these
                encodings. If explicitly using Unicodes from a font, they may show as blocks.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-253: Images are now properly padded and 1 pixel offset is corrected.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-193: Header properly padded.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>GIF, JPG, PNG, PPM</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-218: Blitting of symbols made into renderinghint, which defaults to ON,
                except for JPG which uses non-transparent image to draw in, which would result
                in blitting of images with a black background.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-243: Antialias and AntialiasText are now options for ImageGraphics2D,
                so can be used on any of the image formats. Defaults are on for both,
                except for the GIF format, which defaults both to off since it would
                result in too many colors. The tests use AntialiasText off since
                it seems to generate time-dependent information in the image formats.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-19: JPEG Driver was fixed, uses non-transparent RGB BufferedImage.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-212: GIF and PPM are now ImageIO plugins, separately packaged as jar files.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-212: PNG and JPG are now relying on Sun's implementation. Encoder for PNG is
                still available but may be removed in the future.</li>
            <li>GIF Driver separately packaged so that one can remove it for distribution.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>JAVA</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-214, FREEHEP-238, FREEHEP-237, FREEHEP-263, FREEHEP-270:
                Added JAVA Driver which saves aa Java
                source file of what has been drawn to the screen. This is to enable users to
                easily generate test files. Limitations are currently:
                <ul>
                    <li>no images can be written (FREEHEP-236),</li>
                    <li>displayed component will not resize (FREEHEP-239)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PDF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-95, FREEHEP-255: Logical fonts are mapped to PDF standard fonts.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-94: Implemented drawFrameAndBanner() method.</li>
            <li>Fixed Encoding for FontEmbedderType1</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-203: Cleaned up the PDF output regarding empty objects.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>PS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-250: No fonts are assumed standard in PS/EPS, so all are included
                when requested.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-111: PSFontNames are properly encoded now. GhostScript does not
                complain anymore about Times, Helvetica and others. Symbol and ZapfDingbats
                do not come in Bold or Italic.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-235: Changed encoding of PS from ISOLatin to STDLatin. The hyphen
                now encodes properly.</li>
            <li>Removed EPSIExportFileType since it was not used.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>SVG</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-221: ImageSize can now be properly set and modified.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-258: XML now properly unicode encoded for characters between 0x80 and 0xFF</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-116: Compressed SVG can be read (as .svg or .svgz) in Adobe SVG Viewer 3.0 build76.
                Default setting is now compressed.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-108: Clipping along any path works.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-189: PNG Images now embedded into SVG format.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>SWF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-109, FREEHEP-115: Logical Java fonts properly mapped, and symbol and zapfdingbats encoded.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-200: Symbols and ZapfDingbats fonts are properly mapped to produce glyphs.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-223: DefineJPEG2 and DefineJPEG3 implemented correctly. DefineBits and JPEGTables can only be read
                and written, but cannot be created.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-59: upgraded to version 6.0</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-197: swf file can now be partially compressed for version 6.0</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-195: proper bounding boxes written.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-75: glyphed text added to output.</li>

                It also handles setPaint(TexturePaint) now.</li>
            <li>FREEHEP-22: clip now properly written.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>HepRep</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>FREEHEP-9: HepRep output from C++ and Java now writes scientific format
                for doubles and floats with a precision of 6.</li>
